    <h3 class="rule-title">WHY Construction & Evolution</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Building Your WHY</h4>
        <p>Your organization's purpose (WHY) is constructed from three component types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Core Value:</strong> What your organization fundamentally believes in (e.g., Innovation, Integrity, Impact)</li>
            <li><strong>Beneficiary:</strong> Who benefits from your purpose (e.g., Customers, Society, Future Generations)</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> How you deliver on your purpose (e.g., Through Technology, Through Service, Through Leadership)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example WHY Statement:</strong> "We believe in [INNOVATION] for [FUTURE GENERATIONS] through [TECHNOLOGY]"</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">WHY Component Levels</h4>
        <p>Each WHY component can evolve through three levels of increasing power and specificity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Basic component with a simple ability</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Enhanced component with stronger abilities and synergy options</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Fully evolved component with powerful abilities, scoring benefits, and crisis protection</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Upgrading WHY Components:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spend 3 Action Points to begin the upgrade process for a WHY component</li>
            <li>Place an upgrade token on the component</li>
            <li>When you reach a Milestone space, you may complete one pending upgrade</li>
            <li>You cannot have more than one pending upgrade at a time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">WHY Alignment</h4>
        <p>Your Alignment score (0-10) measures how consistently your actions support your stated purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Alignment (8-10):</strong> Unlocks WHY abilities, provides crisis protection, and scoring bonuses</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate Alignment (5-7):</strong> Standard gameplay</li>
            <li><strong>Low Alignment (2-4):</strong> Reduced effectiveness, vulnerability to certain crises</li>
            <li><strong>Misalignment (0-1):</strong> Severe penalties, higher costs, crisis vulnerability</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Alignment increases when you take actions that support your WHY and decreases when you contradict it.</p>

        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">WHY Pivoting</h4>
        <p>Once per game, at a Milestone space, you may completely pivot one WHY component:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discard your current component and select a new one from your hand or the deck</li>
            <li>The new component enters at Level 1, regardless of the prior component's level</li>

        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Market Influencing</h4>
        <p>Spend Innovation Points to influence the market:</p>

        <p>Once you've mastered Standard Mode, consider trying Expert CEO Mode, which includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic market conditions that change throughout gameplay</li>
            <li>Forced WHY pivot events that test adaptability</li>
            <li>Cascading crisis chains with complex resolution paths</li>
            <li>Industry disruption events that can completely change the game board</li>
            <li>Purpose authenticity audits with potential for alignment penalties</li>
            <li>Complex scoring with multiple paths to victory</li>
        </ul>
