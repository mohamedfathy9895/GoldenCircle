    <h3 class="rule-subtitle">Beginner Mode Modifications</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">1. Simplified WHY Construction</h4>
        <p>Instead of building a custom WHY from individual components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players choose from 6 pre-built WHY statements (each with all three components already combined)</li>
            <li>All WHY statements start at Level 1 with clear abilities</li>
            <li>WHY upgrades are automatic at milestone spaces (no decisions required)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example Pre-built WHY:</strong> "We believe in INNOVATION for FUTURE GENERATIONS through TECHNOLOGY"</p>
            <p><strong>Ability:</strong> Gain +1 Innovation Point when playing Technology-based WHAT cards; Technology HOW cards cost 1 less.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">2. Limited Crisis Challenges</h4>
        <p>Crisis management is simplified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only basic crisis cards are included (advanced and cascading crises removed)</li>
            <li>Crisis cards always offer clear mitigation options</li>
            <li>Players receive 1 "Crisis Skip" token that can be used once per game</li>
            <li>Reduced crisis penalties (maximum -2 on any track)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">3. Resource Bonuses</h4>
        <p>More generous resource management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with 7 of each resource instead of 5</li>
            <li>Gain +1 of each resource automatically each turn</li>
            <li>No resource upkeep costs</li>
            <li>Passing a milestone grants +3 of each resource</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">4. Simplified Scoring</h4>
        <p>Focus on learning the board movement and card plays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary focus on Market Share track (simplified victory condition)</li>
            <li>Automatic +1 Alignment when playing cards that match your WHY (no complex alignment checks)</li>
            <li>20 Market Share needed for victory (instead of 25)</li>
            <li>Reduced board path (30 spaces instead of 40)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">5. Guided Card Choices</h4>
        <p>Cards include beginner-friendly features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommended combinations marked with "beginner" icons</li>
            <li>Simplified card effects (no conditional or delayed benefits)</li>
            <li>Hand cards are always visible to all players for learning</li>
            <li>Recommended card text suggesting optimal plays</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">6. Action Simplification</h4>
        <p>Streamlined turn structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed 3 Action Points per turn (no saving or varying amounts)</li>
            <li>Simple Action Point costs (all actions cost 1 AP)</li>
            <li>No complex partnerships or alliances</li>
            <li>Simple market spaces with clear benefits</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="rule-title">Winning in Beginner Mode</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <p>The game ends when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A player reaches 20+ Market Share points (Market Dominance victory)</li>
            <li>OR a player reaches the Golden Circle Center space</li>
            <li>OR after 10 complete rounds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To determine the winner:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If any player reached 20+ Market Share, they win immediately</li>
            <li>If any player reached the Golden Circle Center with 7+ Alignment, they win</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the player with the highest combined score across all three tracks wins</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example Score Calculation:</strong> Sarah has 15 Market Share + 8 Public Trust + 10 Innovation Points = 33 Total Score</p>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Transitioning to Standard Mode</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <p>Once you've played Beginner Mode and understand the basic mechanics, you're ready to try Standard Mode, which offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Custom WHY construction from individual components</li>
            <li>Strategic WHY upgrades with meaningful choices</li>
