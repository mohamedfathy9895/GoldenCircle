<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Core Concepts</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">The Golden Circle</h4>
        <p>The core philosophy behind the game is Simon Sinek's Golden Circle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHY</strong> - The purpose, cause or belief that drives your organization</li>
            <li><strong>HOW</strong> - The methods, processes, and approaches you use</li>
            <li><strong>WHAT</strong> - The products, services, and offerings you provide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organizations that operate from the inside-out (starting with WHY) tend to inspire loyalty, innovation, and resilience.</p>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Alignment</h4>
        <p>Throughout the game, your decisions will be measured against your stated WHY. Actions that support your purpose increase Alignment; those that contradict it decrease Alignment. High alignment unlocks powerful abilities and protects against crises.</p>
        
        <div class="rule-note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Alignment is not the same as being "good" or "ethical" - it's about consistency with your stated purpose, whatever that may be.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Resources</h4>
        <p>You'll manage three key resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Staff</strong> - Represents human capital, talent, and skills</li>
            <li><strong>Capital</strong> - Represents financial resources and investments</li>
            <li><strong>Brand</strong> - Represents reputation and market presence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Innovation Points are a special fourth resource that can be spent on R&D or Crisis Mitigation.</p>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Progress Tracks</h4>
        <p>Your success is measured on three progress tracks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Share</strong> - Your commercial success and reach</li>
            <li><strong>Public Trust</strong> - Stakeholder confidence and loyalty</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation</strong> - Your organization's creative and adaptive capabilities</li>
        </ul>

She then updates her Market Share (+2) and Innovation (+1) tracks.</p>
