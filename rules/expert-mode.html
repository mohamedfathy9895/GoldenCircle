    <h3 class="rule-title">Expert CEO Mode: The Ultimate Challenge</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <p>Expert CEO Mode is designed for seasoned players who want to experience the full depth and complexity of purpose-driven leadership. This challenging mode introduces dynamic market conditions, cascading crises, complex decision trees, and a more punishing alignment system.</p>
        
        <div class="rule-warning">
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Expert CEO Mode significantly increases game complexity and strategic depth. Players should be thoroughly familiar with Standard Mode before attempting this challenge.</p>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Dynamic Market Conditions</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Market Condition Overlay Tiles</h4>
        <p>Expert Mode introduces Market Condition tiles that change the game environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At the start of each game round, reveal a new Market Condition tile</li>
            <li>Place it on the designated area of the board</li>
            <li>The condition affects all players until replaced</li>
            <li>Some conditions benefit certain WHY/HOW combinations while penalizing others</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example Market Condition:</strong> "Purpose Economy"</p>
            <p>Effect: Players with High Alignment (8+) gain +1 Public Trust each turn. Players with Low Alignment (3 or less) lose 1 Market Share each turn.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Industry Disruption Events</h4>
        <p>Major shifts that can transform entire sectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triggered by specific Crisis cards or when a player reaches a new zone</li>
            <li>Can nullify certain WHAT cards or enhance others</li>
            <li>May create new pathways on the board (shortcut routes)</li>
            <li>Can trigger forced WHY pivots for affected industries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Pop-up Challenges</h4>
        <p>Temporary spaces that appear on the board:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a Pop-up Challenge token on a specific space when triggered</li>
            <li>Any player landing on or passing that space must resolve the challenge</li>
            <li>Challenges typically offer high-risk, high-reward decisions</li>
            <li>Remain on the board for 1-3 rounds, then disappear</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Complex WHY Evolution</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Forced Pivot Events</h4>
        <p>In Expert Mode, your WHY may need to evolve in response to market conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certain crisis cards or market conditions can trigger a Forced Pivot</li>
            <li>When triggered, you must change one of your WHY components</li>
            <li>You have one round to complete the pivot or face severe penalties</li>
            <li>New component enters at one level lower than the pivoted component</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-note">
            <p><strong>Strategic Consideration:</strong> Keep at least one alternative WHY component in your hand as insurance against Forced Pivots.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">WHY Synergy Requirements</h4>
        <p>Expert Mode requires greater cohesion between WHY components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your three WHY components must demonstrate logical synergy</li>
            <li>At each Milestone, players vote on whether your WHY statement is coherent</li>
            <li>If majority votes "no," you must pivot one component or lose 2 Alignment</li>
            <li>WHY components with matching symbols have natural synergy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Purpose Evolution Narrative</h4>
        <p>You must maintain a consistent story about your evolving purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track WHY changes on your Purpose Journey card</li>
            <li>At each Milestone, explain how your purpose has evolved</li>
            <li>If you cannot explain coherently, lose 1 Alignment</li>
            <li>Compelling narratives can earn +1 Alignment (players vote)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Advanced Crisis Management</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Cascading Crisis Chains</h4>
        <p>Crises can trigger chain reactions in Expert Mode:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unmitigated crises may trigger a secondary crisis next turn</li>
            <li>Crisis cards have special "Expert Mode" text that activates chain effects</li>
            <li>Some crises affect multiple players or persist for several rounds</li>
            <li>Crisis resolution choices have far-reaching consequences</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example Cascade:</strong> "Data Privacy Scandal" → If unmitigated, triggers "Regulatory Investigation" next round → If that's unmitigated, triggers "Industry-Wide Regulation"</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Crisis Complexity</h4>
        <p>Expert Mode crises involve more strategic considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple mitigation options with different cost/benefit profiles</li>
            <li>Conditional effects based on your WHY, current Market Conditions, and Alignment</li>
            <li>Opportunity to leverage crises against competitors</li>
            <li>Long-term consequences that may not be immediately apparent</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Crisis Strategy Cards</h4>
        <p>Special cards available only in Expert Mode:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw when landing on a Crisis space (in addition to Crisis card)</li>
            <li>Provide unique ways to address or manipulate crises</li>
            <li>Can be exchanged with other players during partnerships</li>
            <li>Some allow redirection of crisis effects to competitors</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Enhanced Resource Management</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Resource Volatility</h4>
        <p>Resources are less stable in Expert Mode:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player draws a Resource Condition card at start of game</li>
            <li>This card determines which resource fluctuates (gains/loses 1 each round)</li>
            <li>Resource Condition can change when passing a Milestone</li>
            <li>Market Conditions can amplify resource volatility</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Strategic Resource Allocation</h4>
        <p>More complex resource decisions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources must be allocated to specific departments on your player board</li>
            <li>Resources in departments provide ongoing benefits but are harder to reallocate</li>
            <li>Department bonuses activate when 3+ resources are allocated there</li>
            <li>Crisis events may target specific departments, risking those resources</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Resource Conversion Penalties</h4>
        <p>Converting between resource types is less efficient:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard 3:1 conversion rate increases to 4:1 in Expert Mode</li>
            <li>Converting to Innovation Points costs an additional Action Point</li>
            <li>Some resources become restricted during certain Market Conditions</li>
            <li>Borrowed resources (from partnerships) must be repaid with interest</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Expanded Strategic Partnerships</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Mandatory Partnerships</h4>
        <p>Strategic alliances are no longer optional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By the end of Round 3, each player must have at least one partnership</li>
            <li>Players without partnerships lose 1 Public Trust per round</li>
            <li>Some spaces require partnership actions to resolve</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Complex Alliance Types</h4>
        <p>More specific partnership arrangements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Alliance:</strong> Share Innovation Points, collaborate on R&D</li>
            <li><strong>Market Alliance:</strong> Combine Market Share for certain calculations, shared market entry costs</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Alliance:</strong> Pool specific resources, protect from resource-targeting crises</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Alliance:</strong> Share Public Trust benefits, joint crisis mitigation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Alliance Management</h4>
        <p>Partnerships require ongoing attention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each partnership requires 1 Staff resource to maintain each round</li>
            <li>Partnerships degrade if not actively maintained (lose 1 level per round)</li>
            <li>Breaking partnerships has more severe consequences (-3 Trust, -1 Alignment)</li>
            <li>Partnership conflicts arise when partners have opposing goals</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Purpose Authenticity System</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Alignment Audits</h4>
        <p>Regular checks to ensure purpose authenticity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every third round, all players undergo an Alignment Audit</li>
            <li>Compare your actions since the last audit against your stated WHY</li>
            <li>Players vote on each other's alignment (secret ballot)</li>
            <li>Failed audits result in -2 Alignment and -1 Public Trust</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Stricter Alignment Penalties</h4>
        <p>Misalignment has more severe consequences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low Alignment (3 or less): All resources cost +1 to use</li>
            <li>Misalignment (0-1): Cannot form new partnerships, vulnerable to hostile takeovers</li>
            <li>Alignment directly impacts scoring (multiplier for final score)</li>
            <li>WHY abilities only function at appropriate Alignment levels</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Purpose Manifestation Requirements</h4>
        <p>Your organization must demonstrate purpose beyond statements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By the end of Round 5, you must have at least one WHAT card that directly manifests each WHY component</li>
            <li>Purpose-action gaps trigger "Authenticity Crisis" cards</li>
            <li>Stakeholders (other players) can challenge your purpose claims</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Complex Scoring System</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Multidimensional Victory Paths</h4>
        <p>More nuanced victory conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose Excellence:</strong> 10 Alignment + at least 10 on all three tracks</li>
            <li><strong>Market Leadership:</strong> 25+ Market Share (reduced to 20 if Alignment 8+)</li>
            <li><strong>Triple Crown Harmony:</strong> 15+ on all three tracks (reduced to 12 if Alignment 9+)</li>
            <li><strong>Industry Transformation:</strong> Change the Market Condition three times + 15+ Innovation</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy Impact:</strong> Highest combination of all factors when game ends</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Stakeholder Value Calculation</h4>
        <p>Final scoring includes stakeholder considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player secretly assigns weight to the three tracks (must total 10)</li>
            <li>All weights are revealed and averaged</li>
            <li>Final scores use the collective stakeholder value weights</li>
            <li>Example: If collective weight for Public Trust is 4/10, that track counts 40% toward final score</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Purpose Narrative Scoring</h4>
        <p>The story of your journey matters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At game end, present a 1-minute purpose narrative</li>
            <li>Other players rate the coherence and authenticity</li>
            <li>Narrative score (0-5) is added to final score</li>
            <li>Highest narrative score breaks ties</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Expert Mode Setup Differences</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Restricted Starting Resources</h4>
        <p>Begin with fewer resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Staff, 4 Capital, 4 Brand, 3 Innovation Points</li>
            <li>Initial progress tracks also start at 4 each</li>
            <li>Starting Alignment is 4 (not 5)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Strategic Starting Positions</h4>
        <p>Players choose starting positions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In reverse player order, each player places their pawn on any space in the STARTUP zone</li>
            <li>Players immediately resolve that space</li>
            <li>Starting positions determine initial positioning advantages</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Industry-Specific Setups</h4>
        <p>Your chosen Industry card has more impact:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Industry has unique starting resource distribution</li>
            <li>Industries have vulnerabilities to specific crisis types</li>
            <li>Industry determines which WHY components are drawn (stack is filtered)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-example">
            <p><strong>Example Industry:</strong> "Technology Sector"</p>
            <p><strong>Starting Resources:</strong> 3 Staff, 4 Capital, 3 Brand, 5 Innovation Points</p>
            <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> "Data Privacy" crises have +1 severity</p>
            <p><strong>WHY Draw:</strong> Must include at least one Technology-related component</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Expert Mode Gameplay Tips</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHY Flexibility:</strong> Be prepared to pivot your WHY as market conditions change</li>
            <li><strong>Crisis Preparation:</strong> Invest heavily in crisis protection—cascading crises can be devastating</li>
            <li><strong>Partnership Strategy:</strong> Form alliances early but choose partners carefully</li>
            <li><strong>Narrative Consistency:</strong> Maintain a coherent story about your organization's purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Buffers:</strong> Always keep emergency reserves for unexpected challenges</li>
            <li><strong>Balance All Tracks:</strong> Neglecting any progress track creates vulnerability</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose Manifestation:</strong> Ensure your WHAT cards clearly demonstrate your WHY</li>
        </ul>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Advanced Game Variants</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Industry Transformation Challenge</h4>
        <p>For the ultimate strategic test:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Industries undergo complete transformation halfway through the game</li>
            <li>At the second Milestone, all players must discard their Industry card and select a new one</li>
            <li>This forces adaptation of WHY, HOW, and WHAT cards to remain aligned</li>
            <li>Players with High Alignment (8+) during transformation gain 5 Innovation Points</li>
            <li>Players with Low Alignment (3-) during transformation lose 3 Public Trust</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Purpose Revolution Variant</h4>
        <p>For highly competitive groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every 3 rounds, the lowest-scoring player can trigger a "Purpose Revolution"</li>
            <li>All players must pivot at least one WHY component</li>
            <li>Market Conditions change dramatically</li>
            <li>New opportunities arise (draw 2 Opportunity cards)</li>
            <li>Certain HOW strategies become obsolete (discard any with the "Traditional" symbol)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Legacy Campaign Mode</h4>
        <p>For a multi-session experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Play a series of connected games representing decades of business evolution</li>
            <li>Results from each game carry forward as "Legacy Effects"</li>
            <li>Organizations can mature, with WHY components potentially reaching Level 4</li>
            <li>Create a persistent story of your organization's journey</li>
            <li>Final winner determined by cumulative impact across all sessions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-note">
            <p><strong>Legacy Note:</strong> This mode requires permanent modifications to game components (special stickers included). Only use with a dedicated game set.</p>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Expert CEO Resource Management</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Advanced Resource Mechanics</h4>
        <p>Expert CEO mode introduces complex resource interactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Decay:</strong> Unused resources may depreciate at end of round (roll determines)</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Portfolios:</strong> Place resources in investment tracks with risk/reward profiles</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Specialization:</strong> Players may specialize in one resource type for bonuses</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Loans:</strong> Take loans with interest payments due each round</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Department Management</h4>
        <p>Allocate resources to specific organizational departments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R&D Department:</strong> Boosts Innovation Points and crisis protection</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Department:</strong> Enhances Market Share gains and Brand resources</li>
            <li><strong>HR Department:</strong> Improves Staff efficiency and Alignment maintenance</li>
            <li><strong>Finance Department:</strong> Optimizes Capital resources and investment returns</li>
            <li><strong>CSR Department:</strong> Boosts Public Trust and provides crisis protection</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Each department provides escalating bonuses at 3, 5, and 7 resource thresholds, but departments can be targeted by specific crises, putting those resources at risk.</p>

<div class="rule-section">
    <h3 class="rule-title">Competitive Balance Options</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Catch-Up Mechanics</h4>
        <p>To keep the game competitive even with skill disparities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disruption Opportunity:</strong> Trailing players draw from Pivot deck once per game</li>
            <li><strong>Market Correction:</strong> If one player leads by 10+ Market Share, a market correction occurs</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation Breakthrough:</strong> Last place player automatically upgrades one WHY component</li>
            <li><strong>Crisis Protection:</strong> Players below 50% of leader's score gain automatic crisis mitigation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="rule-subtitle">Expert Asymmetry Option</h4>
        <p>For mixed-experience groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experienced players use Expert CEO rules</li>
            <li>Newer players use Standard Mode rules</li>
            <li>Expert players start with reduced resources (-1 each)</li>
            <li>Standard players get one free "Purpose Consultant" card for assistance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rule-note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This combination works surprisingly well and creates mentorship opportunities while keeping the game competitive.</p>

    <h3 class="rule-title">Final Thoughts for Expert Players</h3>
    <div class="rule-content">
        <p>Expert CEO Mode transforms Golden Circle from a board game into a comprehensive business strategy simulation. It best represents the real-world challenges of purpose-driven leadership: maintaining authenticity while adapting to changing markets, balancing multiple stakeholder needs, and transforming organizations during disruption.</p>
        
        <p>This mode works best with 3-5 experienced players and typically takes 2-3 hours to complete. We recommend having a designated "Market Master" player who manages the Market Condition cards and helps track the complex interactions.</p>
